# Code Examples Using AWSSDK

## SQS_Example
This example shows how to use AWSSDK.SQS NuGet Package for Sending messages to a queue and Retrieving messages from a queue.

**Please Note:** The AWS Key and Secret are picked up from the credentials file. On Windows 10, the file path is  `C:\Users\\{username}\\.aws\credentials`

The content of the `credentials` file looks like this:
> [default]
> aws_access_key_id=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
> aws_secret_access_key=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Stay tuned for more to come...

To get the aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key, visit the AWS Console and refer to the IAM section.
